            <h3 class="blog-post-title">So, Why is Following Difficult? </h3>

            <p>The truth is, at intermediate level or above, it becomes mind-boggling how many skill layers a good follower has.  
              However, many find that learning to follow as a beginner to be less overwhelming than learning to lead as a leader.
              This "perceived ease" is the result of several scientific factors and human errors, which is a huge discussion we will not get into here.
              The short story is, <em>in order for the dance to work</em>, </p>
            
            <p>I do want to emphasize one thing, which is the car analogy I used in my Leaders' Starter page.
              In older days and darker times, <strong>teachers refered to leaders as "drivers" and followers as "cars"; this analogy is simply incorrect.</strong>
              Aside from implying objectification and lowering follower's relative importance, the old version of the analogy teaches beginner followers the wrong mindset to succeed.  
              Followers, <strong>you are driving your own "cars".</strong>  You have the power to decide how to move on the dance floor.  
              However, "with great power comes great responsibility", so this also demands more from the followers, but it's a good thing, trust me.<p>

            <p>In my opinion,

            <h3 class="blog-post-title">Good Following is a Mental State with Physical Conditioning</h3>

            <p>If learning to lead is about multi-tasking, then learning to follow is about preparing yourself mentally and physically.  One of my most memorable amazing dances of all time happened with a day-1 follower (to be fair though, she has extensive background in another dance).  
            During a guided practica, I danced with her in close embrace (already a rare feat for day-1 follower, but this also speaks very highly of how good the tango teacher of day is).
            It was going well, yet at one point, she let out a very audible sigh.  I paused and broke away, wanting to ask her what was wrong.  "What's wrong?", she beat me to the punch.
            "Oh I heard you sighing, so I want to check if everything is okay", I replied.  "No no no it was amazing! It was a sigh of pleasure!" 
            There is a word that describe this, but since you're already thinking it, I am not going to spell it out.  
            </p>

            <p>I often think about what makes that dance great.  I mean, she couldn't do any ocho! I only had a 25% rate of success in tricking her to do a proper giro/molinete.
            I did come up with the below list:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>She had impeccable balance.  Even in closer embrace, she was not relying on me for support.  </li>
              <li>As the dance went on, I gradually gained her trust and she relaxed more and more, and then it's as if she understood my lead better, moved smoother, and heard the music the same way I heard it.  </li>
              <li>Unlike many beginner followers, she didn't *work too hard* and rush her steps.  </li>   
            </ul>


            <p>When beginner followers verbally agree to accept my feedback, I find it *always* better to guide them towards improved balance, greater relaxation, and more patience.  
            When these three traits, sometimes they can even figure out how to correctly do a move that they had not learned before.
            Of course, me being the weirdo that I am, I would say "hey you're doing great! I do have one weird suggestion though", then:  </p>
              <ul>
                <li>If that follower has poor balance in open embrace (usually due to poor postures), I would say "imagine I am a ghost and you're trying to mirror my movements on your own."</li>
                <li>If that follower is tense and/or move erratically, I would say "hey, I want you to meet my right earlobe. That's my favorite earlobe.  Try only looking at my right earlobe and stay in front of it."</li> 
                <li>If that follower is rushing and/or anticipating my lead, I would say "would it be possible for you to dance lazy? No need to work too hard."</li> 
              </ul>

            <p>These ridiculous suggestions are round-about ways to unload my followers' brains and guide them towards improved balance and greater relaxation. 
            Now that you know my secrets, you might be pleased to know that, <strong>improved balance by engaging your core muscles is actually what allows those fast, flashy moves to happen; 
            greater relaxation is a technique that one very advanced follower used on me to unshackle my creative side as a lead; patience makes your dance more smooth and graceful</strong>.  Yeah, these three traits might just serve you for years to come.  </p>
            
            <p>These three traits directly influence the quality of your following, which I tend to define it as <em> connection</em>.
            As tango teacher Mira Barakat said, 
            <pre><code>Tango is only possible when you and your partner have a connected embrace,
like how electrons can only flow in a complete circuit.  </code></pre>
              Someone should nominate her for a Nobel prize for this quote.  All these preparation steps are to prepare followers' minds and bodies for a good connection.
            </P>

            <h3 class="blog-post-title">Reasons I Enjoy Dancing with Beginner Followers</h3>

            <p>I very much enjoy dancing with beginner followers. Don't believe me? See reasons below:  </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Leading a beginner follower forces me to focus on musicality.  </li>
                <li>I, as a leader, will have off-days; I feel embarassed to lead intermediate/advanced followers on my off-days, but I still want to dance.</li>  
                <li>Since it is harder to lead a move correctly with a beginner follower, when it works, it is *much* more satisfying for both me and my follower.  </li>  
              </ul>
            <p>Somewhat related, I actually knows a leader who <em>only</em> dances with beginner followers; I guess I am not the worst weirdo in town.  </P>
