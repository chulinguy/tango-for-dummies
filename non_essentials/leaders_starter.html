            <br>
              <div class='clearfix'>
                <div class='col-xs-6'>
                  <img src='http://www.shearcomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dog-Driving-Meme.jpg' class='img-responsive float-left'>
                </div>
                <div class='col-xs-6'>
                  <p class='pull-right'>There is a popular analogy that leading in tango is like driving a car. Note: I don't like driving a car üëé, 
                    but I still love to lead in tango üëç.</p>  
                  <p>Imagine it's your first time learning how to drive:  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Driving vehicle:</em> Your vehicle has stick-shift only.  
                  Oh, and depending on your age and wealth, your vehichle can range from a brand new Porshe 911 or an old Lincoln limousine.</li>
                <li><em>Traffic signs:</em> The route you take has many one-way streets, rapid change of speed limits, etc.</li>
                <li><em>Navigation:</em> You have to drive in the craziest part of New York City.</li>
                <li><em>Companion car:</em> oh, did I mention your whole family is in another car behind you, trying to follow you because they don't know the desination?</li>  
              </ul>

              <p>Yeah, I am pretty sure I would crash my car &#128561;.</p> 

              <p>Notice though, if you isolate just one element, as in just focusing on driving with a stick-shift car, 
                but you do it in an empty school parking lot where are there no traffic signs, no other stranger cars, and not having to worry about losing your companion car,
                suddenly it becomes much more manageable. Keep that in mind as you tackle a leader's challenges.</p>

              <p>Leading in tango is difficult because leaders have to multi-task on the dance floor.  
                As a leader, I have to drive my own body ("driving vehicle"), manage my follower's axis ("companion car"), 
                avoid jams and collisions with other dancers and walls ("navigation)", and also observe and interpret the music ("traffic signs").  
                This seems daunting at first, but with practice, it's not only doable but also can be done on semi-cruise-control (shhhh don't tell my followers).
                Over time, you will develop good driving habits, familiary with music, and better awareness that makes leading easier.</p>

              <p>See next section for strategy to manage multi-tasking. <strong>‚ö† Your priority is to NOT crash your "companion car"!</strong></p>
              <pre><code><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Leaders, like drivers, have to multi-task</code></pre>

            <h3 class="blog-post-title">[Beginner] How to Multi-task on the Dance Floor</h3>
            <br>
            <img src='https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAe3AAAAJDkxYjg2MmVkLTBkNWQtNDg2NC1hNGE3LTJkNmVhOWM3NGQxNA.jpg' alt='Multitasking' class="img-fluid" > 
            <p><em>This is how I used to be on the dance floor</em></p>           
            <!--<br>-->
            <p>As mentioned above, there are essentially four elements at play when you lead: your body, your follower's axis, music, and floor traffic.   
                Understanding this, we can employ the following FDA-approved strategies: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Your body:</em> signal where you want to go early by subtle changes in your embrace.  
                Signaling techniques by embrace include additional compression, subtle vertical lift, leaders' spinal rotation, etc.  
                Benefits of signalling early:
                <ul>
                <br>
                  <li>Higher rate of success on leading moves because follower has time to prepare his or her body accordingly.  
                    Note: there are a few "surprise tango moves" (for example, rebound <em>boleo</em>) that are the exceptions to this principle, 
                    but you shouldn't worry about those yet.</li>
                  <li>It follows the ISO 9001 principle of <em>"say what you do & do what you say."</em></li>
                  <li>Makes it easier for your follower to look out floor traffic for you.  
                    Note: some followers prefer to dance with their eyes closed but this usually only happen with more advanced leaders.</li>
                  <li>This is a learning pre-requisite for quicker weight changes, sycopated steps, and Commercial Truck Licenses üöö.</li>  
                </ul> 
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><em>Follower's axis:</em> start by dancing simple to earn your follower's trust.  
                It's easier to lead and follow when both partners trust each other and relax because intents and motions translate to your partner better.  
                In the beginning, managing your follower's axis is all about translating your own intent to your follower, and the channel is open as long as there is trust.  
                Without a trusting partner, it's impossible for you to defeat the final boss of this üéÆaction RPG gameüéÆ called tango.  
                </li>
              <br>
              <li><em>Musicality:</em> listen to tango songs at home, particular when you shower.  You do shower, right?  
                It's much easier to respond to changes in the music when you already know when the changes are coming.

                Now you have some basic music understanding, it's time to be creative on the dance floor and experiment with simple, familiar "ingredients"!  
                Some ideas for experimenting include: varying move speed, pauses, half-steps/fake-steps, etc.  
                Experimenting with simple, familiar steps has many benefits:
                <ul> 
                <br>
                  <li>Fun with follower of all levels</li>
                  <li>The best way I know to "fake it until you make it"</li>
                  <li>Lower risk of stepping/tripping/mentally bruising your follower üíî</li>
                </ul> 
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><em>Floor traffic:</em> feel free to make bigger moves when there is space. When it's crowded, dance simple and smaller so you can easier react and avoid jams.
              Note: the standard practice for a crowded milonga is that leaders leave each other space for one and only one back step.  Multiple back-steps is a recipe for disaster!</li>
            </ul>
          <p>As you've probably noticed by now, '"dance simple" is the universal solution to multi-tasking on the dance floor.  
            As tango teacher Glenn Corteza once said to me,
            <em>Leading in tango is like computer programming; stay with familiar codes!</em> 
            Maybe that's why there are so many software programers in Bay Area tango community.   
          </p>
             
          <p><strong>"Dance simple" also allows you to improve the quality of your lead</strong>, which we'll talk about in the next section.
          <strong>Note, you as a leader is only responsible for 50% of the dance, so only blame yourself 50% when something doesn't work as expected üòù, or 33% if you do a three-people tango (that's a real thing).</strong></p>
            
          <pre><code><strong>TL;DR</strong>: dance simple but play with musicality; signal early; no multiple back-steps</code></pre>

            <h3 class="blog-post-title">[Advanced Beginner] How Good is my Lead?</h3>
            <br>
              <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0BzybsaJP9M7MVGdkR0FnYl9WZTg' alt='I-was-intoxicated' class="img-fluid">
              <p><em>Oh wow, I look drunk on tango</em></P>
              <p>As your <em>America's Got Talent</em> judge, I tend to rank how good a leader's lead is by that leader's follower's facial expression.
              Smiles during fun songs are great, intoxicated look during emotional songs are wonderful.
              If you're not sure what a tango smile look like, watch <a href='https://youtu.be/F2zTd_YwTvo' target='_blank'>this scene</a> from Scent of a Woman.  
              If you're not sure what tango intoxication looks like, I've included a picture of me as an intoxicated follower above.    
              Follower's facial expression is actually the most accurate criterion here, but it's also very elusive.</p>
              <p>A tangible way to define the quality of your lead is the "3 C's" of tango, taught by tango teacher Homer Ladas:
                <em> Clarity, Consistency, and Comfort </em>
                Some tips regarding the 3 C's:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Clarity:</em> use your spin to make linear movements linear and circular movements circular, etc.</li>
                <li><em>Consistency:</em> practice drills.</li>
                <li><em>Comfort:</em> unless the embrace is collapsing, "more force" is pretty much never the solution.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The 3 C's expose a specific trait of high-quality tango lead: minimum effort and maximum intention. 
                Minimum effort requires less force ('comfort') and reduces noises ('clarity' and 'consistency');
                maximum intention makes a lead easy to follow ('clarity' and 'consistency') but not overpowering ('comfort').
                Honestly, it takes a life time to pursue such perfection, I would focus on making your follower smile or intoxicated.</p>
              <pre><code><strong>TL;DR</strong>: be clear, consistent, and comfortable</code></pre>

            <h3 class="blog-post-title">[All Levels] Brain Overload!</h3>
            <br>
              <a href='http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/' target='_blank'>
                <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0BzybsaJP9M7McTNWVjRyTkstSEE' alt='I want to hit the panic button' class="img-fluid">
              </a>
              <p><em>Please do NOT click on the above image!</em></P>
              <p>If all goes according to plan, there will be moments on the dance floor where tango difficulty becomes (close to) overwhelming.  
                This is not only normal but a good sign that you are stepping out of your comfort zone to experience and learn new elements.  <strong>In my opinion, 
                the first step to transition from a beginner leader to an intermediate leader is 
                admitting that learning to lead is quite difficult and be okay with that difficulty.  </strong>
                This is quite a profound sentence, so I recommend you to read that again. </p>
              
              <p>I have a theory that quite often the beginner leaders that find leading in tango overwhelming are the ones that become great leaders.  
                The basis behind this theory is that these leaders are simply <em>more aware of what's going on</em>, so they are sensitive to every minor mistake.  
                I also see naturally-confident leaders get stuck, unable to become better because they are oblivious to their weaknesses and instead, 
                rely on their followers to compensate (or their teachers to yell at them).</p>

              <p>However, if you feel close to panicking, just slow down and think about enjoying a nice walk with your partner. 
                After all, tango is just fancy walking while staying connected with a partner to the music (this quote probably upsets 50% of the Argentina population).  
                Another option is to sit down and take a break and enjoy watching other dancers and listening to music.
                You might see or hear something that would inspire new ideas.</p>
