    "tips": "Tips for leaders: \n \nRemember that your weight change's goal is to induce the follower's weight change, so you may have to make the shift bigger or smaller depending on your follower.  \n*ADVANCED* A follower's weight change actually has a 'shape', which is 'flat' as long as there is some weight on both of follower's feet.  As soon as all the weight is on only one of follower's foot, there is a very slight 'dip', which is your cue to weight change to other direction or start walking.  \n \nTips for followers: \n \nKeep your heels as close as possible! The reason for this is you want to stay as tall as possible during weight changes; height change is actually an effective technique to convey intention to your tango partner. To be honest though, I keep my heels together for weight changes just because it looks better \uD83D\uDE00"

    "tips": "Tips for leaders: \n \nMove from your center! Imagine you're pulling a person tied to your waist.  Actually, stop imagining this and try this out! Use a bath towel (or a beat-up jacket) to hack a makeshift towing waist harness, and ask one of your minion friends to hold the ends of the towel and stand still two feet behind you.  Try to tow your friend in a smooth manner.  This is the feeling for a great walking lead.  \n*ADVANCED* Try moving your free foot a split second after the followers does.  \n \nTips for followers: \n \nI believe that it is mostly the follower's responsibility to let your leader know 'where you are', so please provide a little bit extra pressure when the leader is walking forward; this will also make you more stable.  \n*ADVANCED* If you wear high heels during dancing, get a more experienced follower to show you how to land on your whole foot, instead of landing on just the ball of your foot.  This is the trick to be able to dance all night.  "

    "tips": "Tips for leaders: \n \nAn ocho cortado is a much more intuitive way to lead into 'cross' in my opinion.  For the 8-count basic way, remember that you are still walking straight forward but utilizing you chest rotation (dissociation) to bring the follower back in front of you at the end of the 'cross.  \n \nTips for followers: for the 8-count basic way, take a larger step right before the 'cross' happens, to create more room for the 'cross'.  It is tricky to figure out if you should weight-transfer to your front foot after the 'cross', in most cases it's safer to transfer right away.  "

    "tips": "Tips for leaders: \n \nengage your back muscles, which will prevent over-using your arms and help keep your upper body quiet. \n \nTips for followers: as a leader, I subconciously distinguish intermediate followers from beginner followers by the quality of the follower's giro/molinete; that is becaue giros/molinetes are difficult.  There are three important points (don't rush, take long steps, and be consistent).  Practice with chair.  For the close embrace version, replace the back step with a back cross, and, optionally, replace the forward step with a front cross.  *ADVANCED* followers, to get around your leader faster, stay extra light during the back step(don't transfer all your weight).
