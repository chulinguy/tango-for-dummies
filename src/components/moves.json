    "tips": "Tips for leaders: \n \nGood place to come back to take a tiny break.  \n*ADVANCED* A follower's weight change actually has a 'shape', which is 'flat' as long as there is some weight on both of follower's feet.  As soon as all the weight is on only one of follower's foot, there is a very slight 'dip', which is your cue to weight change to other direction or start walking.  \n \nTips for followers: \n \nKeep your heels together! Not only would you look taller but you would have better posture too \uD83D\uDE00"

Please provide a little bit extra pressure when the leader is walking forward; this also makes you more stable.  \n*ADVANCED* If you wear high heels, get a more experienced follower to show you how to land on your whole foot, not just your heel."
